            <h2>Voracious Food Reviews</h2>
            
            <p>
                As someone who loves visiting restaurants, I enjoy reviewing the foods I eat just as much to help friends and workmates. With today's digital age, many diners are referring to online restaurants/food reviewing websites as reading reviews are a great way to grasp the general idea of a dish.

            <p>
                It is said that 90% of diners research a restaurant online before deciding where to eat which is why I have decided to make a database reviewing 10 different dishes I have eaten.
