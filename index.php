                As someone who loves visiting resteraunts, I enjoy reviewing the foods I eat just as much. With today's digital age, many diners are referring to online resteraunt/food review websites as reading reviews are a great way to grasp the rating of a dish. It is said that 90% of diners research a resteraunt online before deciding where to eat which is why I have decided to make a database reviewing 10 different dishes I have eaten.
